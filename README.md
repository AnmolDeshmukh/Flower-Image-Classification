# Flower-Image-Classification
This project is about image classification by using the deep neural network (DNN) or also
known as Deep Learning by using framework TensorFlow. Python is used as a programming
language because it comes together with TensorFlow framework. Libraries such as Keras,
Numpy, matplotlib and Pillow are used. The input data mainly focuses in flowers category which
there are five types of flowers that have been used in this project. Deep neural network
(DNN) has been choosing as the best option for the training process because it produced a high
percentage of accuracy.

This is a group project which is done as a part of Mini Project Competition conducted by Dr. D. Y. Patil Institute of Engineering, Management and Research.
